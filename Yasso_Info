Model Description

Dynamic model of the cycling of organic carbon in soil. Yasso calculates the amount of soil organic carbon, changes in the amount of soil organic carbon and heterotrophic soil respiration. Current applications of Yasso include earth system modeling, global climate simulations, greenhouse gas inventories and research on land ecosystems and climate change.
